## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The biggest challange I faced is working with remote acess on a mac. At times the computer was really slow and at one point I had to restart my computer
since I clicked a command only found on microsoft device was caused a error on my Mac remote access. As of right now I finished the MVP and hopefully once the weekend rolls
around I will get the chance to work on the optional section of the assigment once I catch up with the rest of the class.
